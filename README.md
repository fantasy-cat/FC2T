# FC2T

This is an extension to FC2's Lua module. As a part of our open-source initiative, the `fc2.hpp` file is publicly accessible. This extends to the [documentation](https://constelia.ai/sdk/) as well. Whether or not you are a member of constelia.ai (fantasy.cat), you are free to explore the examples given for better understanding and to see the potential of FC2 along with its subsidiaries. This transparency and public accessibility are the primary reasons why this repository is public.

This extension requires Universe4 to be running. This project is not functional without access to an FC2 solution.
